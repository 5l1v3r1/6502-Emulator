6502-Emulator
=============

6502 emulator written in C# as a portable class library

It's a long time since I did any 6502 assembly, and in fact a long time since I did any assembly at all, so doubtless this will be full of bugs!

I'm really just writing it for nostalgic fun after realising I've never written an emulator of any fashion but who knows, maybe something useful will come of it.
